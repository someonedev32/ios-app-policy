    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">
      App: <strong>VoxDo</strong><br />
      Effective date: <strong>February 21, 2026</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      VoxDo is an offline-first task manager for iPhone. This policy explains what data VoxDo processes, how it is used,
      and the choices you have.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Your tasks are stored locally on your device.</strong> VoxDo does not run its own backend for task data.</li>
      <li><strong>No account required.</strong> VoxDo does not require login to use core features.</li>
      <li><strong>Subscriptions are handled via Apple and RevenueCat.</strong> These services process purchase-related data.</li>
      <li><strong>Voice input is optional.</strong> If you enable it, iOS processes your speech according to Apple’s system services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>VoxDo is designed to minimize data collection. Depending on how you use the app, VoxDo may process:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Task content</strong> (e.g., titles, notes, completion status, dates, reminders, priorities) — stored locally on-device.</li>
      <li><strong>Voice input</strong> (optional) — used to convert speech to text for creating tasks.</li>
      <li><strong>Purchase and subscription information</strong> — used to unlock Pro features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To create, display, and manage your tasks and reminders on your device.</li>
      <li>To enable voice-based task creation when you choose to use it.</li>
      <li>To validate subscriptions and unlock Pro features.</li>
      <li>To provide basic app functionality and improve reliability (e.g., handling purchase status correctly).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Task Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      VoxDo stores task data <strong>locally on your iPhone</strong> using on-device storage. VoxDo does not upload your tasks to
      VoxDo-owned servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Voice Input and Speech Recognition</h2>
    <p>
      VoxDo can create tasks from voice. When you use voice input, the app requests access to the microphone and speech recognition.
      Speech recognition is provided by Apple system services. Depending on your device settings and Apple’s implementation,
      speech recognition may require an internet connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      VoxDo does not sell or rent your voice data. VoxDo uses voice input only to convert your speech into text to create tasks.
    </p>

 <h2>Subscriptions (Monthly / 6-Month / Yearly)</h2>
<p>
  VoxDo offers three subscription options: <strong>Monthly</strong>, <strong>6-Month</strong>, and <strong>Yearly</strong>.
  Subscriptions are managed through your App Store account and renew automatically according to the selected plan.
  You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time from your App Store account settings.
</p>
<p>
  Purchases are processed by Apple’s App Store. VoxDo uses <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to validate subscription status
  and manage entitlements (Pro access).
</p>
<p>
  Purchase-related data (such as a transaction identifier, subscription status, and receipt information) may be processed by:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Apple</strong> (App Store / StoreKit) — payment processing and subscription management.</li>
  <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> — subscription validation and entitlement management.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  By subscribing, you agree to Apple’s standard End User License Agreement (EULA):<br />
  <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/
  </a>
</p>
      For details on how these providers handle data, refer to their privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>
      If you enable reminders, VoxDo schedules <strong>local notifications</strong> on your device. Notification content is generated
      from your task data and delivered by iOS on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
    <p>
      VoxDo does not include third-party advertising SDKs and does not use cross-app tracking for advertising purposes.
      If analytics are used in the future, this policy will be updated before changes take effect.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>VoxDo does not sell your personal data. VoxDo shares data only in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers</strong> (Apple, RevenueCat) strictly for subscriptions and purchase validation.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal requirements</strong> if required to comply with applicable law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Task data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app. Subscription data is retained by Apple and RevenueCat
      as required to operate subscriptions and comply with legal obligations.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Voice permissions:</strong> You can enable/disable Microphone and Speech Recognition in iOS Settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> You can enable/disable notifications in iOS Settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Delete data:</strong> You can delete tasks within the app or uninstall the app to remove local app data.</li>
      <li><strong>Manage subscriptions:</strong> You can manage or cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID subscription settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      VoxDo is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your country). We do not knowingly collect personal
      information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>International Users</h2>
    <p>
      If you use VoxDo outside your country of residence, purchase-related data may be processed by Apple and RevenueCat in countries
      where they operate.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the effective date above and, when
      appropriate, provide notice within the app or on the app listing.
